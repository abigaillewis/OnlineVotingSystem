        <!-- Information about me as a developer (as in specification) -->
        <div class="box">
                <p> I am currently completing a Computer Science Degree at the University of Warwick with a year abroad
                    at Monash University. Over the course of my degree I have developed a large range of programming skills in languages
                    such as Java, C and Haskell. Additionally, in terms of web development I have worked on two projects
                    both of which used HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript and a MySQL database. The first was a Todo list 
                    application that allowed users to create and add items to list. The second was a Bill Spliter, an
                    application that allowed a group of University students to upload and divide household bills. This 
                    application also integrated email notifications that informed users when new bills were added.</p>
